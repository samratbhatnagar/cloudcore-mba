# CloudCore MBA

The CloudCore MBA workshop provides an Architecture Design Session (ADS) experience focused on understanding and selling the Azure Value Proposition.

## Abstract

In this workshop, you will work with a fictional customer, the Contoso Sports League Association (CSLA), to modernize their e-commerce site and its underlying infrastructure. CSLA is a large sports franchise and they are struggling to keep up with demand from their growing customer base. They currently host an e-commerce website and have a backend website that supports their call center, allowing employees to view order information.

CSLA would like to modernize their websites and move to the cloud, ultimately moving away from managing infrastructure. They are interested in whether platform-as-a-service (PaaS) will meet their needs so they can completely remove the infrastructure management overhead. However, they are concerned about securing their websites and data to meet the stringent PCI (Payment Card Industry) compliance requirements.

Throughout this workshop, you will take an in-depth look at an end-to-end e-commerce solution running on platform-as-a-service (PaaS) services in Azure. You will review resources running in Azure and learn about the value each of these services brings to customers.

At the end of this workshop, you will have a better understanding of the customer value delivered by Microsoft Azure.
